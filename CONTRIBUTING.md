## Running Tests

Run the test suite using pytest:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=expsetup tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_logger.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v tests/
```

## Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

### Black (Code Formatting)

```bash
# Format all code
black expsetup/ tests/ examples/

# Check formatting without changes
black --check expsetup/
```

### isort (Import Sorting)

```bash
# Sort imports
isort expsetup/ tests/ examples/

# Check import sorting
isort --check-only expsetup/
```

### flake8 (Linting)

```bash
# Run linter
flake8 expsetup/ tests/
```

### mypy (Type Checking)

```bash
# Run type checker
mypy expsetup/
```

### Run All Checks

```bash
# Format code
black expsetup/ tests/ examples/
isort expsetup/ tests/ examples/

# Run checks
flake8 expsetup/ tests/
mypy expsetup/
pytest tests/
```

## Making Changes

   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Write clear, concise code
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add docstrings to new functions/classes
   - Update tests as needed

3. **Add tests:**

   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request:**
